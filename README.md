# E-Commerce Funnel Analysis

Welcome to my deep-dive into e-commerce user behavior! This project is my hands-on exploration of how shoppers move through the online funnel—from browsing to carting to buying—using real multi-category store data, SQL, and Python.

## What You'll Find Here

-   **SQL Scripts:** My first stop for slicing and dicing the data (`SQL Queries/EDA.sql`).
-   **Jupyter Notebook:** Where the magic happens—visualizations, metrics, and insights (`Python NoteBooks/EDA.ipynb`).
-   **Results:** All the juicy outputs and summaries in `EDA Results (SQL + Python)/`.
-   **Project Notes:** My thought process and methodology in `Idea.md`.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to see what really drives conversion in e-commerce. How many people just browse? Who actually adds to cart? What makes someone buy? And what categories are hot? This project is my way of answering those questions with data, code, and a bit of curiosity.

## Key Insights & Metrics (October 2019)

-   **Total Views:** 40,710,876
-   **Carts Created:** 926,366
-   **Purchases Made:** 742,849
-   **Cart-to-Purchase Conversion:** 80.2%
-   **View-to-Cart Conversion:** 2.3%
-   **View-to-Purchase Conversion:** 1.8%
-   **Top Category:** electronics.smartphone
-   **Highly Engaged Users (multiple sessions):** 1,546,232

## How I am working on this

1.  Import the raw CSVs into SQL Server (SSMS Import Wizard)
2.  Run my SQL queries for a first look
3.  Dive into the Jupyter notebook for deeper analysis and beautiful charts
4.  Check out the results folder for all the exports and summaries

## Tech Stack

-   SQL Server (T-SQL)
-   Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, pyodbc
-   Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

-   Install SQL Server and SSMS
-   Set up Python with pandas, pyodbc, matplotlib, seaborn
